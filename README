README for Amith Ananthram

The code should all work without any segfaults or leaks anywhere.
No code was taken from the solutions emailed out.

Special Notes:

Crawler:
	Everything is normal as far as I can gather.

Indexer:
	The index.dat file gets saved in the target directory!

Query:
	Typing in "q" in the queryengine will exit the program.

	A note on ranking: 

	For words ANDed together, rank = sum of individual occurences per page.
		
	For a certain page, if (cat AND dog) OR mouse was the query, and the 
	first QUERY had a rank of 10 for that page, and the second QUERY had
	a rank of 11, the page's overall rank is 11 (OR defaults to the larger).

Extra Credit (changing MAX_HASH to 10 from 10000):

At 10:
	Completes without segfaults.  Takes 6:22 to complete, with 1986 files downloaded.

At 10000:
	Completes without segfaults.  Takes 6:25 to complete, with 1978 files downloaded.
